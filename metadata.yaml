summary: '"Moufflou, and other stories" by Ouida is a collection of short stories
  written in the early 20th century. The book primarily revolves around themes of
  love, sacrifice, and the bonds between humans and animals, with a particular focus
  on the charming poodle named Moufflou and his interactions with a poor family living
  in Florence. The stories reflect the struggles of the characters against societal
  challenges and their relationships with their beloved pets.  In the titular story,
  "Moufflou," the narrative follows a poor family, whose members cherish their poodle,
  Moufflou, and the joy he brings. The eldest son, Tasso, works hard to support the
  family, while his young, crippled brother Lolo forms a special bond with Moufflou.
  As the story unfolds, the family faces the harsh reality of military conscription
  and the difficult decision of selling Moufflou to pay for a substitute for Tasso.
  This heartbreaking choice leads to emotional turmoil for Lolo, who falls ill from
  the loss of his beloved dog. However, the story culminates in a touching reunion
  when Moufflou finds his way back home, showcasing the themes of loyalty and the
  deep emotional ties between pets and their owners. The additional stories in the
  collection also explore various facets of life, nature, and the human experience,
  woven together with Ouida''s characteristic flair for vivid descriptions and emotional
  depth. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
